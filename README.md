AutoLayoutDemo
===========================

This is a simple project demonstrating the use of Auto Layout. 

AppDelegate.m needs to be changed to compare the use of:

- No Auto Layout at all.
- iOS built-in Auto Layout calls (NSLayoutConstraint)
- Use of the PureLayout library.

I highly recommend using [PureLayout](https://github.com/smileyborg/PureLayout)
